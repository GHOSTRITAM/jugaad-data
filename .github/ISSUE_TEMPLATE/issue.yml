        Thanks for your interest in jugaad-data! ðŸš€

        I'm creating a simple checklist and a form to collect details  about the issue/bug you are facing.

        This is required to avoid back and forth conversation and time delay to collect most basic information without which its very difficult to replicate the issue and hence difficult to resolve.

  - type: textarea
    id: description
    attributes:
      label: Issue description
      description: |
        What is the problem, question, or error?

        Write a short description telling me what you are doing, what you expect to happen, and what is currently happening.
      placeholder: Expected behaviour and what actually happened
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: dropdown
    id: os
    attributes:
      label: Operating System
      description: What operating system are you on?
      multiple: true
      options:
        - Linux
        - Windows
        - macOS
        - Other
    validations:
      required: true
   - type: textarea
    id: example
    attributes:
      label: Example Code

        Please add a self-contained, [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with your use case.

        If I (or someone) can copy it, run it, and see it right away, there's a much higher chance I (or someone) will be able to help you.
